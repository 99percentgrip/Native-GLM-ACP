# glm_acp

ACP agent server for Z.ai GLM models.

## Purpose

Implements the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) server that Zed launches as a
subprocess. Wraps the Z.ai BigModel API directly to provide native reasoning
streaming, 1M context, and auto-continuation for long generations.

## Ownership

- **Entry point**: `__main__.py` → `cli.py:main()` → `agent.py:run()`
- **CLI, terminal auth, and uninstall routing**: `cli.py` → `main()` / `configure_credentials()`
- **Public-install removal**: `uninstall.py` — frozen-copy validation, command/PATH cleanup, credential purge, and guarded Zed JSONC editing
- **Frozen executable entry**: `launcher.py` → absolute import of `cli.main()`
- **ACP protocol**: `agent.py` — implements `acp.Agent` (initialize, new_session, load_session, resume_session, close_session, list_sessions, prompt, set_config_option, set_session_mode)
- **GLM API client**: `glm_client.py` — SSE/tool streaming, preserved thinking, cancellation, retry, cache usage, auto-continuation
- **MCP**: `mcp.py` — official Z.ai remote/local services and configured HTTP/stdio servers
- **Project knowledge and learning**: `memory.py` — scoped memory, relevant skills/bundles, telemetry, curation, and evaluated candidates
- **Untrusted-context defense**: `security.py` — promptware findings, stored-context blocking, and tool/MCP/recall delimiters
- **Tools**: `tools.py` — file/shell operations sandboxed to workspace roots
- **Config**: `config.py` — model registry, API key, constants
- **Persistence and recall**: `session_store.py` — JSON conversation state plus a local redacted SQLite FTS5 search index

### Entry point resolution

The agent is launched by Zed as `python3 -m glm_acp`. For `-m` to resolve
the module from any cwd (not just this repo's directory), the package MUST
be installed into the venv: `uv pip install -e .` from the repo root. See
the root `AGENTS.md` "Install and distribution (binding)" section.

Public ACP Registry installs launch the frozen `native-glm-acp` executable
instead. The `glm-acp` console script, `python -m glm_acp`, and frozen binary
must all route through `cli.main()`.

## Local Contracts

### Registry authentication

- `initialize()` always advertises `zai-api-key-setup` as Terminal Auth with `args=["--setup"]`.
- `--setup` prompts with hidden input and atomically stores credentials in a user-only file.
- `ZAI_API_KEY` and `Z_AI_API_KEY` override stored credentials.
- API keys must never appear in stdout, stderr, logs, test output, or ACP messages.
- `authenticate()` succeeds only for the advertised method and configured credentials.

### Public-install removal

- `glm-acp --uninstall` operates only from the user-local frozen-binary install directory; source and Registry-managed executables fail safely with guidance.
- Removal deletes both public command aliases and only the exact PATH marker created by the installer, including a profile selected through `GLM_ACP_SHELL_PROFILE`.
- A matching custom `agent_servers.glm-acp` entry is removed from Zed JSONC only after a same-directory command match, with a sibling backup created first; Registry and unrelated entries remain untouched.
- Stored credentials survive normal uninstall. `--uninstall --purge` removes only the credential file and does not delete sessions or other configuration.

### Token stream routing

GLM SSE deltas are split at parse time and never mixed:
- `delta.reasoning_content` → `on_reasoning()` callback → `agent_thought_chunk` session update (thinking view)
- `delta.content` → `on_content()` callback → `agent_message_chunk` session update (code/response)
- `delta.tool_calls` → accumulated, then reported via `tool_call` / `tool_call_update`

Small text and reasoning deltas are coalesced before ACP updates. An HTTP 200
stream that ends without `[DONE]` or a finish reason is incomplete: retry it
only if no user-visible delta was emitted; otherwise preserve the partial
response and report `network_error` without replaying duplicate text.

### Auto-continuation

When `finish_reason == "length"` and no tool calls are pending, the client
auto-sends a bare "continue" message (up to `MAX_AUTO_CONTINUATIONS` = 20
times) so long multi-file refactors don't stall mid-generation. Exhausting the
cap reports `continuation_limit`; it never silently presents a capped response
as complete.

### Context compaction (Claude Code parity)

When estimated token usage exceeds `COMPACTION_THRESHOLD` (85%) of the model's
context window, `_maybe_compact()` in `agent.py` fires:

1. The system prompt is preserved verbatim.
2. The most recent `COMPACTION_KEEP_RECENT` (4) messages are kept verbatim.
3. Decisions, fixes, unresolved work, plan state, edited paths, command outcomes,
   and session lineage are extracted deterministically before older messages are
   discarded. Verified decisions/fixes become inspectable, permission-required
   memory proposals rather than automatic writes.
4. Everything else is sent to `GlmClient.summarize_messages()` which makes a
   dedicated non-streaming API call with a structured summarization prompt
   (disabled thinking, `COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS` ceiling). The optional
   auxiliary model performs this call when its context can hold the source;
   otherwise compaction falls back to the main model. `/compact <focus>` adds
   bounded guidance.
5. The summary is wrapped in `<conversation_summary>` tags and inserted as a
   user message between the system prompt and the preserved recent messages.

This mirrors Claude Code's compaction: summarize the past, keep the present.
Compaction is transactional: invalid, missing, or empty summaries leave the
original history unchanged. Tool call IDs and names remain explicit in the
summary transcript so results cannot be detached from their calls.
Context-pressure messages fire once at 60%, 75%, and 85% until compaction
reduces the tier. Completion reports the exact retained categories and a
persisted deterministic summary-quality score; a 15-point decline from the
previous compaction produces a warning.

### Promptware defense

- Root instructions, project/user memory, and learned skills are scanned before
  prompt injection; suspicious stored sections are blocked.
- File, tool, MCP, embedded-resource, delegated-worker, session-recall output,
  and context passed into a delegate are wrapped in `untrusted_context`
  delimiters before the receiving model sees them.
- Findings are defense in depth and never replace sandboxing, secret removal,
  destructive-tool permissions, or operator review.
- Learning rejects credential-shaped and prompt-injection content before writing.

### Auxiliary routing and delegation

- `auxiliary_model=main` uses the primary model; another non-vision GLM model on
  the active API plan handles titles, compression, recall ranking, advisory skill
  evaluation, and delegated analysis, with local/deterministic fallback where
  possible.
- `delegate_task` is permission-gated and limited to three workers per parent
  turn. All workers share 24 tool calls, 120K input tokens, and 16K output tokens.
  Each worker has six read/search iterations and 180 seconds; it cannot edit,
  execute, call MCP, access credentials, or delegate recursively, so depth is one.
- Auxiliary usage contributes to parent totals. Compression clients are pooled;
  delegated clients are transient and all clients close with the session.

### Usage reporting

After each API call, `agent.py` sends a `UsageUpdate` session notification to
the client (Zed) with `size` (context window) and `used` (estimated tokens).
If the API returns `usage.prompt_tokens`, that exact value is used; otherwise
a heuristic estimate (chars ÷ 4) is applied. This drives Zed's context bar.

**Important:** The `UsageUpdate` must include `session_update="usage_update"`
(the ACP discriminant field). Omitting it causes a Pydantic validation error
and crashes the turn.

### Config options

Session config options advertised to the client:
- `model` (category: `model`) — GLM model selector
- `thought_level` (category: `thought_level`) — reasoning depth: Off / Standard (all models); Deep · High / Deep · Max (GLM-5.2 only, maps to `reasoning_effort: high|max`)
- `permission_mode` (category: `permissions`) — tool execution permission: Ask / Read Only / Bypass
- `generation_profile` (category: `other`) — Balanced provider defaults, Precise temperature 0.7, or Exploratory top-p 0.98; non-default profiles adjust only one sampling control
- `auxiliary_model` (category: `other`) — main model or a non-vision GLM model on the active plan for titles, compaction, recall ranking, skill evaluation, and bounded delegation

### Deep Thinking (GLM-5.2)

GLM-5.2 supports `reasoning_effort` as a top-level API parameter (values:
`"high"`, `"max"`). The `thought_level` config option maps the UI selection to
both `thinking.type` and `reasoning_effort` in the API request body. When the
model is switched away from GLM-5.2, deep levels are hidden and the thought
level falls back to Standard automatically.

Coding Plan Standard and Deep High/Max requests set
`thinking.clear_thinking=false`, and exact returned `reasoning_content` is
retained in assistant history as required for subsequent requests. Disabled
thinking and Standard API standard reasoning clear prior traces.

### Permission system

Destructive tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `apply_patch`, `run_command`,
`store_memory`, generic/local MCP execution) are gated by the
session's `permission_mode`:
- **Ask** — read-only tools run freely; destructive tools trigger a
  `session/request_permission` round-trip so Zed can show an approval dialog
- **Read Only** — destructive tools are blocked entirely; the model is told
  why and can adapt
- **Bypass** — all tools auto-approved, no prompts

Permission state is stored per-session and persisted to disk.

### Image / screenshot handling

GLM-5.2, GLM-5-Turbo, and GLM-4.7 are **text-only models** — the Z.ai
Coding Plan API endpoint rejects image content with error 1210/1213.
Direct vision model access (GLM-5V-Turbo) is not included in the Coding
Plan API.

When a user pastes a screenshot from the clipboard:
1. `_extract_prompt_parts()` separates image data from text in the ACP
   prompt blocks
2. `_save_images()` writes each image to `.glm-acp-images/` inside the
   session's workspace root
3. The user message sent to the model includes the saved file paths and a
   note that GLM-5.2 cannot view images directly
4. The user is notified in the panel where the screenshot was saved

This prevents the "prompt parameter was not received normally" (1213) crash
and preserves the screenshot for the built-in permission-gated Z.ai Vision MCP
tool or manual inspection. GLM-5V-Turbo is available for direct multimodal use
on Standard API and BigModel with a 200K context window.

### Sandbox

All file tool operations validate paths against the session `cwd` and
`additional_directories`. Paths outside workspace roots raise `ToolError`.
Text-file tools decode strict UTF-8 with universal-newline normalization and
consistently treat invalid UTF-8 or NUL-containing data as binary on every
supported platform.

Filesystem tools run off the ACP event-loop thread. Search uses `rg` when
available with a portable fallback. Read/search calls in the
same model batch may execute concurrently, while edits and commands remain
ordered. Tool and embedded-resource output is bounded; truncated file reads
include a `start_line` continuation hint. Command output streams live, final
results include the exit code and bounded stdout/stderr, and timeouts terminate
the complete process group. Child commands receive normal runtime variables but
not common inherited API keys, tokens, passwords, secrets, private/access keys,
credentials, or SSH agent access.

Within one model turn, three consecutive identical tool-call batches trigger a
synthetic recovery result. If the model repeats the batch again, the turn stops
instead of consuming the full iteration budget. Malformed JSON tool arguments
are rejected with schema-oriented corrective feedback before permission or
execution.

Command results carry structured exit codes. After a failed or timed-out
command, the model receives one automatic verification-recovery turn before it
may finish, directing it to inspect the failure, preserve tests, correct the
root cause, and rerun the narrowest relevant check or report a genuine blocker.
After a successful file edit, the model likewise receives one recovery turn if
it tries to finish before a successful verification command has been observed.

### MCP and durable memory

Z.ai Search and Reader use authenticated Streamable HTTP MCP. Vision uses the
official optional `@z_ai/mcp-server@latest` stdio server and therefore requires
Node.js 22+; starting it is permission-gated. Custom MCP servers come from the
user-only `mcp.json` and may reference environment variables for headers.
Concurrent MCP discovery initializes each server once. HTTP 404/410 session
expiry performs one clean reinitialize-and-retry, while dead or timed-out stdio
processes discard stale protocol state before restart.

Root `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GLM.md` are loaded into the managed system
prompt. Reusable facts are opt-in and stored only after permission in the
workspace's `.glm-acp/memory.md`; secrets and transient reasoning must not be stored.

After a task passes a recognized verification command, the turn receives
one bounded learning review. Non-obvious reusable procedures may be written only
after permission to `.glm-acp/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Skill metadata is loaded
into the managed prompt, full instructions are read on demand, credential-like
content is rejected, and deletion is limited to this agent-owned directory.

Explicit user facts and preferences may be stored after permission in private
cross-project `user.md`; project facts remain in `.glm-acp/memory.md`. Both are
bounded, secret-filtered, inspectable, and support exact forgetting.

Learned-skill telemetry tracks views, uses, and revisions. Deterministic curation
marks 30-day idle skills stale and reversibly archives 90-day idle skills only
after permission. Pinned skills are protected by code and curation never deletes.
Content hashes route manually changed skills to review, and deterministic
description overlap evidence may suggest consolidation but never auto-merges.

Optional `platforms`, `environments`, `requires_tools`, and semantic `tasks`
frontmatter gates keep irrelevant learned skills out of the managed prompt.
Task-gated metadata is re-evaluated against every current user request.
Project-local bundles group up to 12 existing relevant skills without copying
their bodies and load them progressively through `read_skill_bundle`; stored
bundle instructions are re-scanned when read.

Skill evolution is candidate-based. Failed benchmark traces can create a bounded
non-promotable `.draft.json` safeguard proposal. Compatible completed held-out
baseline/candidate reports must cover identical attempts, improve pass rate,
avoid every per-case regression, avoid any median-latency regression, and avoid
any input-plus-output token-cost regression. Passing only stages
`.candidates/<name>.json`; promotion still requires permission, verifies the
staged content hash, and keeps the active skill unchanged until that action.

`session_store.py` indexes user, assistant, and tool content locally with FTS5
for discovery and contextual scrolling. It excludes system prompts and reasoning
fields, redacts credential-shaped content, backfills legacy JSON sessions, and
removes index rows when a session is deleted.

### Session persistence & history replay

Conversation state (messages, model, mode, title) is persisted to disk
(`~/.glm-acp/sessions/<id>.json`) after every prompt turn and config change.
On `session/load` and `session/resume`, the agent rebuilds the `Session` from
disk via `Session.from_dict`.

Each session also has a small `.meta` sidecar for listing without parsing full
conversation histories. Disk persistence is dispatched off the event loop,
turns are serialized per session, and one pooled GLM HTTP client is reused until
the session's model, endpoint, or thinking configuration changes. Agent
shutdown and session close must close pooled clients.
Session close releases runtime resources but preserves persisted/searchable
history; deletion is a separate storage operation and must never be inferred
from close.
Forks persist `parent_session_id` plus `branch_root_id`; `/lineage` exposes direct
children and identifies the parent session as the rollback path.

**Critical:** The ACP `LoadSessionResponse` and `ResumeSessionResponse` only
carry `modes`, `config_options`, and `models` — they do **not** include message
history. To make the restored conversation visible in the editor UI, the agent
must replay it back via `session_update` notifications. `_replay_history()`
walks the persisted messages and sends each user turn as a
`user_message_chunk` and each assistant turn as an `agent_message_chunk`.
System messages and tool-result entries are skipped (internal bookkeeping).
The server runs with `use_unstable_protocol=True` to expose
`session/list`, `session/resume`, and `session/close`.

## Work Guidance

- Match existing code style: `from __future__ import annotations`, dataclasses for state, type hints throughout
- Keep `glm_client.py` free of ACP-specific imports — it's a pure API wrapper
- Keep `agent.py` free of HTTP/SSE logic — it's a pure ACP layer
- Never write reasoning text to files; it flows only through `agent_thought_chunk`
- Do not weaken the verification prerequisite, permission gate, secret filter, size bounds, or project-local ownership boundary for learned skills.
- Do not auto-promote evolved skills, let delegates mutate state, or treat promptware heuristics as a security boundary.
- Keep session recall local and bounded; never index system prompts, exact reasoning traces, or credential-like values.
