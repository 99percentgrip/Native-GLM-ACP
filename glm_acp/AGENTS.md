# glm_acp

ACP agent server for Z.ai GLM models.

## Purpose

Implements the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) server that Zed launches as a
subprocess. Wraps the Z.ai BigModel API directly to provide native reasoning
streaming, 1M context, and auto-continuation for long generations.

## Ownership

- **Entry point**: `__main__.py` → `cli.py:main()` → `agent.py:run()`
- **CLI and terminal auth**: `cli.py` → `main()` / `configure_credentials()`
- **Frozen executable entry**: `launcher.py` → absolute import of `cli.main()`
- **ACP protocol**: `agent.py` — implements `acp.Agent` (initialize, new_session, load_session, resume_session, close_session, list_sessions, prompt, set_config_option, set_session_mode)
- **GLM API client**: `glm_client.py` — SSE streaming, reasoning/content separation, tool_call assembly, auto-continuation
- **Tools**: `tools.py` — file/shell operations sandboxed to workspace roots
- **Config**: `config.py` — model registry, API key, constants
- **Persistence**: `session_store.py` — JSON file store for conversation state in `~/.glm-acp/sessions/`

### Entry point resolution

The agent is launched by Zed as `python3 -m glm_acp`. For `-m` to resolve
the module from any cwd (not just this repo's directory), the package MUST
be installed into the venv: `uv pip install -e .` from the repo root. See
the root `AGENTS.md` "Install and distribution (binding)" section.

Public ACP Registry installs launch the frozen `native-glm-acp` executable
instead. The `glm-acp` console script, `python -m glm_acp`, and frozen binary
must all route through `cli.main()`.

## Local Contracts

### Registry authentication

- `initialize()` always advertises `zai-api-key-setup` as Terminal Auth with `args=["--setup"]`.
- `--setup` prompts with hidden input and atomically stores credentials in a user-only file.
- `ZAI_API_KEY` and `Z_AI_API_KEY` override stored credentials.
- API keys must never appear in stdout, stderr, logs, test output, or ACP messages.
- `authenticate()` succeeds only for the advertised method and configured credentials.

### Token stream routing

GLM SSE deltas are split at parse time and never mixed:
- `delta.reasoning_content` → `on_reasoning()` callback → `agent_thought_chunk` session update (thinking view)
- `delta.content` → `on_content()` callback → `agent_message_chunk` session update (code/response)
- `delta.tool_calls` → accumulated, then reported via `tool_call` / `tool_call_update`

### Auto-continuation

When `finish_reason == "length"` and no tool calls are pending, the client
auto-sends a bare "continue" message (up to `MAX_AUTO_CONTINUATIONS` = 20
times) so long multi-file refactors don't stall mid-generation.

### Context compaction (Claude Code parity)

When estimated token usage exceeds `COMPACTION_THRESHOLD` (85%) of the model's
context window, `_maybe_compact()` in `agent.py` fires:

1. The system prompt is preserved verbatim.
2. The most recent `COMPACTION_KEEP_RECENT` (4) messages are kept verbatim.
3. Everything else is sent to `GlmClient.summarize_messages()` which makes a
   dedicated non-streaming API call with a structured summarization prompt
   (disabled thinking, `COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS` ceiling).
4. The summary is wrapped in `<conversation_summary>` tags and inserted as a
   user message between the system prompt and the preserved recent messages.

This mirrors Claude Code's compaction: summarize the past, keep the present.

### Usage reporting

After each API call, `agent.py` sends a `UsageUpdate` session notification to
the client (Zed) with `size` (context window) and `used` (estimated tokens).
If the API returns `usage.prompt_tokens`, that exact value is used; otherwise
a heuristic estimate (chars ÷ 4) is applied. This drives Zed's context bar.

**Important:** The `UsageUpdate` must include `session_update="usage_update"`
(the ACP discriminant field). Omitting it causes a Pydantic validation error
and crashes the turn.

### Config options

Session config options advertised to the client:
- `model` (category: `model`) — GLM model selector
- `thought_level` (category: `thought_level`) — reasoning depth: Off / Standard (all models); Deep · High / Deep · Max (GLM-5.2 only, maps to `reasoning_effort: high|max`)
- `permission_mode` (category: `permissions`) — tool execution permission: Ask / Read Only / Bypass

### Deep Thinking (GLM-5.2)

GLM-5.2 supports `reasoning_effort` as a top-level API parameter (values:
`"high"`, `"max"`). The `thought_level` config option maps the UI selection to
both `thinking.type` and `reasoning_effort` in the API request body. When the
model is switched away from GLM-5.2, deep levels are hidden and the thought
level falls back to Standard automatically.

### Permission system

Destructive tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `run_command`) are gated by the
session's `permission_mode`:
- **Ask** — read-only tools run freely; destructive tools trigger a
  `session/request_permission` round-trip so Zed can show an approval dialog
- **Read Only** — destructive tools are blocked entirely; the model is told
  why and can adapt
- **Bypass** — all tools auto-approved, no prompts

Permission state is stored per-session and persisted to disk.

### Image / screenshot handling

GLM-5.2, GLM-5-Turbo, and GLM-4.7 are **text-only models** — the Z.ai
Coding Plan API endpoint rejects image content with error 1210/1213.
Direct vision model access (GLM-5V-Turbo) is not included in the Coding
Plan API.

When a user pastes a screenshot from the clipboard:
1. `_extract_prompt_parts()` separates image data from text in the ACP
   prompt blocks
2. `_save_images()` writes each image to `.glm-acp-images/` inside the
   session's workspace root
3. The user message sent to the model includes the saved file paths and a
   note that GLM-5.2 cannot view images directly
4. The user is notified in the panel where the screenshot was saved

This prevents the "prompt parameter was not received normally" (1213)
crash and preserves the screenshot for use with the Z.ai Vision MCP Server
or manual inspection.

### Sandbox

All file tool operations validate paths against the session `cwd` and
`additional_directories`. Paths outside workspace roots raise `ToolError`.
Text-file tools decode strict UTF-8 with universal-newline normalization and
consistently treat invalid UTF-8 or NUL-containing data as binary on every
supported platform.

### Session persistence & history replay

Conversation state (messages, model, mode, title) is persisted to disk
(`~/.glm-acp/sessions/<id>.json`) after every prompt turn and config change.
On `session/load` and `session/resume`, the agent rebuilds the `Session` from
disk via `Session.from_dict`.

**Critical:** The ACP `LoadSessionResponse` and `ResumeSessionResponse` only
carry `modes`, `config_options`, and `models` — they do **not** include message
history. To make the restored conversation visible in the editor UI, the agent
must replay it back via `session_update` notifications. `_replay_history()`
walks the persisted messages and sends each user turn as a
`user_message_chunk` and each assistant turn as an `agent_message_chunk`.
System messages and tool-result entries are skipped (internal bookkeeping).
The server runs with `use_unstable_protocol=True` to expose
`session/list`, `session/resume`, and `session/close`.

## Work Guidance

- Match existing code style: `from __future__ import annotations`, dataclasses for state, type hints throughout
- Keep `glm_client.py` free of ACP-specific imports — it's a pure API wrapper
- Keep `agent.py` free of HTTP/SSE logic — it's a pure ACP layer
- Never write reasoning text to files; it flows only through `agent_thought_chunk`

## Verification

```bash
# Full test suite
.venv/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/ -q

# Import check
.venv/bin/python3 -c "from glm_acp.agent import GlmAcpAgent; print('OK')"

# ACP handshake test (no real API key needed)
ZAI_API_KEY=test .venv/bin/python3 -c "
from glm_acp.agent import GlmAcpAgent
import asyncio
agent = GlmAcpAgent()
r = asyncio.run(agent.initialize(protocol_version=1))
assert r.protocol_version == 1
s = asyncio.run(agent.new_session(cwd='/tmp'))
assert s.config_options[0].category == 'model'
assert s.config_options[1].category == 'thought_level'
print('Handshake OK')
"
```

Tests live in `tests/` (pytest + pytest-asyncio). Run before merging any
change to `glm_client.py`, `agent.py`, `tools.py`, or `session_store.py`.
