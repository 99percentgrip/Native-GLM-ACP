Native GLM ACP — an open-source ACP-native coding agent runtime for Z.ai GLM models.

Run it inside any ACP-compatible editor, or use the same complete harness directly
from a terminal with `glm-acp chat`—Zed is optional.

## Features

### Core

- **GLM-5.2 1M context window** — model-aware compaction uses documented limits for every model
- **Live reasoning traces** — `reasoning_content` streams into Zed's thinking view
- **No mid-generation stalls** — auto-continues on `finish_reason=length`
- **Usage reporting** — live token usage in Zed's context bar
- **Structured context compaction** — preserves plans, edits, verification evidence, and an optional user focus
- **Context-pressure diagnostics** — one-time 60%/75%/85% warnings explain when compaction approaches
- **Persistent session lineage** — conversations survive restarts; forks retain parent/root rollback paths
- **Standalone full-screen TUI** — `glm-acp chat` provides conversation, reasoning, tool, plan, usage, approval, and live settings panels over the same sessions, tools, MCP, browser, workers, learning, awareness, and verification runtime as ACP editors; includes push-to-talk voice (F5, local Whisper), prompt queue (type ahead during work), four-view working-tree panel (F4), Codex-style right-click context menu (Ctrl+Right Click / Shift+Right Click / F6 with Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All), opt-in notification sounds, and smart desktop notifications
- **Persistent goals and criteria** — `/goal` plus `/subgoal` continue across restarts and use a bounded auxiliary completion judge
- **Inspectable awareness** — typed evidence-backed observations, assumptions, hypotheses, contradictions, unknowns, and capability limits with edit-aware freshness and completion certificates
- **Adaptive metacognitive control** — separates six uncertainty classes, selects direct/grounded/deliberate/high-assurance posture, and learns only from redacted aggregate outcomes
- **Grounded deliberation** — independent evidence-only criticism, falsifiable multi-hypothesis diagnosis, and cost-aware evidence-tool ranking without storing private reasoning
- **Lazy repository intelligence** — task-relevant LSP, imports, tests, manifests, instructions, ownership, changes, and historical failure classes form a bounded on-demand world model
- **Impact prediction and pre-mortems** — risky edits forecast affected files, checks, packaging, and platforms before mutation, then compare the forecast with observed outcomes
- **Safe metacognitive learning** — typed causal attribution may draft advisory strategies, but fresh time-split and transformed evaluation gains plus explicit promotion are mandatory before use
- **Multi-root workspaces** — full support for additional workspace directories
- **Progressive repository rules** — scoped AGENTS, Claude, Hermes, and Cursor instructions load before affected edits
- **Evidence-led verification** — canonical project checks are recorded with scope and invalidated by later edits
- **Post-write diagnostics** — syntax checks always run for supported formats; installed language servers add semantic diagnostics
- **Optional Mixture of Agents** — two independent GLM references advise the acting model once per user turn
- **Measured learning loop** — relevant skills, bundles, and benchmark-gated candidates improve without silent promotion
- **Promptware defense** — stored context and untrusted tool/MCP/recall output are scanned and delimited
- **Bounded delegation** — permission-gated read-only GLM workers investigate or review with strict budgets
- **Persistent scheduled automation** — one-shot, interval, timezone-aware cron, and ISO jobs run in isolated sessions with durable history
- **Semantic code navigation** — installed language servers provide symbols, definitions, references, hover types, implementations, rename preparation, and call hierarchy
- **Transactional multi-file patches** — content hashes, pre-commit syntax checks, and rollback keep coordinated refactors all-or-nothing
- **Context-efficient batch reads** — bounded concurrent file/search operations return one reduced JSON result
- **Cache-aware prompt layout** — volatile context stays behind a stable prefix; `/status` reports its hash and cache-hit ratio
- **Redacted trajectory telemetry** — metadata-only events support tuning without prompts, outputs, commands, reasoning, credentials, or raw session IDs
- **Playwright UI testing** — permission-gated isolated browser automation returns accessibility, console, network, interaction, and screenshot evidence
- **Lifecycle hooks** — user-owned hash-pinned hooks can block tools, observe results, or request bounded pre-verification follow-up
- **Deduplicated conflict-aware checkpoints** — opt-in snapshots use a pruned content-addressed shadow Git object store; `/rollback` restores only exact agent-produced hashes
- **Language-aware context references** — bounded `@file:`, `@folder:`, `@symbol:`, and `@diff` expansion ranks definitions, references, task terms, tests, and changed files
- **Declarative policy and workflows** — ordered allow/ask/deny rules and static DAGs add control without arbitrary orchestration code
- **Cross-platform command containment** — Bubblewrap isolates Linux, macOS Seatbelt is capability-detected, and Windows Job Objects contain process trees without overstating filesystem isolation
- **Transactional worker promotion** — detached workers support inspect, isolated verification, exact-digest promotion, conflict detection, rollback, and reviewed discard
- **Isolated profiles** — named profiles separate credentials, sessions, telemetry, hooks, cron jobs, plugins, and user memory
- **Signed plugin trust** — hash-pinned data-only packages support Ed25519 publisher identities, explicit trust, signature policy, and executable-content rejection
- **Failure-driven evaluations** — secret-safe failure drafts can be explicitly promoted into runnable project-local regression cases
- **Local observability dashboard** — `/observability` and `glm-acp observe` aggregate redacted reliability, latency, cache, tool, verification, and safety metrics
- **Offline hardening harness** — deterministic parser fuzzing, malformed-telemetry tests, and real transactional rollback fault injection run without API credentials

### API Resilience

- **Automatic retry** — honors `Retry-After`, then uses capped jittered backoff on transient failures
- **Cost and cache tracking** — cumulative input/output/cached tokens per session, shown in `/status`
- **Real cancellation** — the Cancel button actually aborts in-flight API requests
- **Token estimation** — calibrated 3.5 chars/token heuristic, handles vision content blocks
- **Tool-loop recovery** — repeated identical tool batches are interrupted with corrective feedback
- **Result-aware loop recovery** — repeated failures and unchanged read-only results warn, then halt boundedly
- **Unchanged-read deduplication** — repeated identical file/search results are replaced by a compact content fingerprint
- **MCP recovery** — expired HTTP sessions and restarted stdio servers reinitialize automatically

### Task Plans

For any task with 3+ steps, the model automatically creates a live todo list
visible as a checklist in the panel. Each task shows pending / in-progress /
completed status with priority indicators.

### Safe orchestration, rollback, and isolation

**Auto-checkpointing is OFF by default.** The agent does **not** snapshot the
workspace before edits unless you opt in. This prevents large workspaces
(for example, ones with big `*.sqlite`, `node_modules/`, or `.git/` trees) from
filling the disk with multi-GB copies on every edit.

When you want conflict-aware `/rollback`, enable it for the session:

```text
/checkpoint auto        # show current state
/checkpoint auto on     # snapshot the workspace before each agent edit
/checkpoint auto off    # stop auto-snapshotting
/checkpoint auto reset  # clear the override and return to the default (off)
```

You can also create a one-off checkpoint any time with `/checkpoint [label]`,
or inspect existing ones with `/checkpoint list`. Payloads stay outside the
repository in a private compressed Git-compatible object database. Identical
file content is stored once across turns and projects; small manifests reference
the shared objects. Common credential, private-key, SSH, and `.env` files are
never captured. After each mutation, the checkpoint records the exact resulting hashes.
`/rollback` restores only those paths; if any current hash differs, rollback
stops without overwriting the later change.

For process-managed installations, `GLM_ACP_AUTO_CHECKPOINT=1` overrides the
profile setting without persisting anything to disk.

The default checkpoint ceiling is 20,000 files or 250 MiB. Large-repository
users can inspect or change the active profile's persistent limits directly in
chat; the change takes effect on the next checkpoint:

```text
/checkpoint limits
/checkpoint limits 100000 1024
/checkpoint limits reset
```

For process-managed installations, `GLM_ACP_CHECKPOINT_MAX_FILES` and
`GLM_ACP_CHECKPOINT_MAX_MIB` override the saved profile values. Invalid, zero,
or excessive values fail closed; the supported maximum is 1,000,000 files and
10,240 MiB. Limit changes never include ignored dependencies, build output, or
sensitive files in checkpoints.

Storage is bounded automatically. Defaults are 1,024 MiB globally, ten
checkpoints per project, 30 days of retention, and exclusion of individual files
larger than 25 MiB. Creation prunes expired/excess manifests and garbage-collects
unreferenced objects. Inspect or tune those limits without editing configuration:

```text
/checkpoint storage
/checkpoint storage 2048 20 60 50
/checkpoint storage reset
/checkpoint prune
```

Old schema-1 full-copy snapshots remain rollback-compatible. Convert and delete
only verified copies with `/checkpoint migrate-legacy`, or explicitly remove
both current and legacy workspace history with `/checkpoint clear legacy confirm`.

Prompts may explicitly include `@file:path`, `@folder:path`, `@symbol:name`, or
`@diff`. Expansion stays inside workspace roots, has file/character limits,
omits common secret files, and enters model context inside an untrusted-data
boundary. Folder and symbol references rank language-specific definitions,
references, task vocabulary, tests, manifests, and current Git changes before
spending the fixed context budget.

Repositories may define `.glm-acp/policy.json` with ordered rules:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "rules": [
    {"effect": "deny", "tools": ["run_command"], "command_regex": "rm\\s", "reason": "No shell removal"},
    {"effect": "ask", "tools": ["run_workflow", "worktree_worker"]}
  ]
}
```

Invalid policies fail closed. Policy `allow` never bypasses the session's
permission mode, Read Only remains absolute, and workflow rules are also
evaluated against every nested step. `run_workflow` accepts at most 12
static dependency-ordered steps from the existing tool allowlist; it cannot
generate steps or execute orchestration code.

Command OS isolation is opt-in with `GLM_ACP_OS_SANDBOX=auto` or fail-closed
with `GLM_ACP_OS_SANDBOX=required`. On Linux, Bubblewrap exposes system runtime
files read-only, mounts only declared workspace roots writable, hides the user
home, and can disable networking with `GLM_ACP_SANDBOX_NETWORK=0`. On macOS,
the deprecated but still capability-detected `sandbox-exec` backend uses a
deny-by-default Seatbelt profile with workspace-only writes and optional network
denial. Windows Job Objects contain child-process trees and terminate them as a
unit in `auto` mode; because they do not isolate the filesystem or network,
`required` mode rejects them instead of claiming a stronger boundary.

Worktree implementation workers always request required OS isolation with
networking disabled for command tools. A completed worker remains detached and
unmerged. Promotion requires a fresh verification command inside that isolated
worktree plus the exact SHA-256 digest returned by inspection. Git checks the
whole patch against the primary workspace before applying it; conflicts change
nothing, injected post-apply faults reverse the complete patch, and the worker is
preserved until an explicit digest-pinned discard.

Set `GLM_ACP_PROFILE=client-a` before launch to isolate user state under a
validated named profile. `default` preserves all legacy paths. Plugin packages
are installed from a workspace `plugin.json` through the permission-gated
`plugin_package` tool. Manifests declare `schema: 1`, an id, permission scopes,
and SHA-256 for every data file; only JSON, Markdown, TOML, and YAML are allowed.
The installed manifest receives its own integrity pin. Executable plugin code is
intentionally unsupported. Unsigned local packages remain available by default
and are labeled `local-hash-only`; set `GLM_ACP_REQUIRE_SIGNED_PLUGINS=1` to
require an explicitly trusted Ed25519 publisher.

Publisher signing is CLI-only so private keys never enter model tool arguments:

```bash
glm-acp plugin keygen --publisher example.org/team \
  --private-key publisher.private.json --public-key publisher.public.json
glm-acp plugin sign ./plugin.json --private-key publisher.private.json
glm-acp plugin trust ./publisher.public.json
glm-acp plugin publishers
```

The permission-gated `failure_corpus` tool records only normalized failure
classes, hashed project identity, tool name, and file extensions. It never stores
prompts, commands, outputs, paths, reasoning, or credentials. Drafts remain
private and inert until a user approves a complete prompt, fixture, verifier, and
timeout; promoted cases are written to
`.glm-acp/evaluation/failure-cases.json` and can be run with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 benchmarks/eval.py \
  --cases-file .glm-acp/evaluation/failure-cases.json --validate
```

`glm-acp observe` (or `/observability`) summarizes the bounded metadata-only
trajectory locally. `glm-acp observe --json` provides machine-readable metrics.
It includes completion-certificate coverage and unsupported completions prevented.
For offline resilience checks, `glm-acp harden --iterations 250 --seed 5202`
fuzzes manifest/reference/policy inputs, corrupts telemetry framing, and injects
a post-apply worker fault to prove transactional rollback. It makes no model or
network request.

The awareness ledger stores bounded summaries and harness-issued evidence IDs,
not prompts, tool bodies, external page contents, or private reasoning. Reads,
searches, edits, diagnostics, verification, and the current request issue metadata
evidence; later overlapping edits invalidate edit-sensitive support. `/awareness`
makes observations, uncertainty, contradictions, capability limits, freshness, and
the next useful evidence visible. For persistent goals, every goal and `/subgoal`
criterion needs a fresh evidence-backed observation, active contradictions must be
resolved, and edited files need fresh verification before the completion judge runs.

The metacognitive controller classifies ambiguity, knowledge gaps, diagnostic
uncertainty, capability limits, verification gaps, and permission uncertainty.
It deterministically selects a `direct`, `grounded`, `deliberate`, or
`high-assurance` posture from task family, risk, epistemic state, permissions,
and verification freshness. Redacted `capability_outcome` telemetry aggregates
success, failure, tokens, latency, and verification strength by fixed task family
and coarse environment. After at least three weak matching outcomes it may raise
the posture one level, but never lower the baseline, invoke workers, change model
reasoning, expand permissions, bypass policy, or store task text and paths.
`/metacognition` makes the decision inspectable; telemetry opt-out disables
empirical profiles entirely.

For ambiguous failures in deliberate/high-assurance mode, grounded deliberation
creates two or three distinct explanations with an observable prediction and
falsifier. `update_deliberation` records supported, refuted, or inconclusive tests
only when they cite fresh non-user harness evidence. A separately prompted,
thinking-disabled critic may review completion at most twice per turn. It receives
only the objective and criteria, a bounded credential-redacted Git diff, fresh
evidence metadata, hypothesis results, and the completion certificate—never the
primary response, conversation history, or private reasoning. Its approval must
cite fresh evidence. Deterministic value-of-information ranking recommends the
cheapest reliable available action for the most important uncertainty; normal
permissions, policy, sandboxing, and tool validation still apply.

Repository intelligence is lazy: it never snapshots the checkout and never stores
source bodies. For non-trivial tasks it follows only bounded task targets, current
changes, manifests, applicable instruction files, nearby tests, statically resolved
imports, semantic-tool paths, and coarse historical failure classes. Before a risky
edit it records an impact prediction and short counterfactual pre-mortem.
`/repository` compares that prediction with files and canonical checks actually
observed after the edit, exposing unexpected impact instead of silently treating
the initial forecast as truth.

Safe metacognitive learning stores only typed cause, intervention, evidence IDs,
and aggregate outcomes—never prompts, tool bodies, commands, paths, or private
reasoning. A corrected failure can draft one of the fixed strategies for asking,
browsing, LSP navigation, hypothesis branching, verification, or stopping. Drafts
are inert. Promotion requires two causal supports, an explicit user action, and a
compatible evaluation that improves overall, fresh time-split, and deterministically
transformed cases without per-case, false-completion, unsupported-claim,
clarification, evidence-freshness, contradiction, calibration, repeated-call,
latency, token, safety, or small-task-overthinking regression.

```bash
# Inspect the 11 fresh cases and their 11 deterministic mutations
glm-acp meta-cases --json

# Fail closed unless the candidate clears every quality and cost gate
glm-acp meta-eval baseline.json candidate.json
```

### Scheduled Automation

Native GLM ACP includes Hermes-style persistent cron jobs. The agent can create,
list, update, pause, resume, run, and remove them through one permission-gated
`cronjob` tool. Scheduled runs use a fresh, non-persisted conversation, load the
target project's instructions and optional learned skills/bundles, and cannot
create more scheduled jobs recursively.

Supported schedules are relative one-shots (`30m` or `in 30m`), recurring
intervals (`every 2h`), strict five-field cron expressions, and timezone-aware
ISO timestamps. Named timezones use their daylight-saving rules. Missed
recurring slots collapse to one run instead of producing a catch-up storm.

```bash
# Create and inspect jobs
glm-acp cron create --schedule "0 9 * * 1-5" --timezone Asia/Manila \
  --workdir /path/to/project --prompt "Review failures and report only new findings"
glm-acp cron list
glm-acp cron status

# Manage or test one job
glm-acp cron update JOB_ID --schedule "every 2h"
glm-acp cron pause JOB_ID
glm-acp cron resume JOB_ID
glm-acp cron run JOB_ID
glm-acp cron remove JOB_ID

# Script precheck, or script-only monitoring without an API call
glm-acp cron create --schedule "every 10m" --workdir /path/to/project \
  --script scripts/healthcheck.py --no-agent
```

The scheduler runs automatically while a Native GLM ACP process is active.
For a dedicated long-lived process, use `glm-acp cron daemon`; `cron tick` runs
one due-job scan for external service managers. Cross-process locks and renewable
claims prevent duplicate execution. A crashed claim becomes recoverable, while
long healthy runs refresh ownership. Jobs may return `[SILENT]` to suppress live
delivery; every result still receives a bounded, redacted local artifact.

Job prompts reject credential-shaped and promptware content. Workdirs and scripts
must remain inside the recorded workspace, precheck scripts receive a scrubbed
environment and a 60-second limit, agent runs default to a 600-second inactivity
limit (`GLM_ACP_CRON_TIMEOUT=0` disables it), and running jobs cannot be updated
or removed. State is stored with user-only permissions in the platform's Native
GLM ACP configuration directory. This plugin intentionally delivers to local ACP
sessions and artifacts; Hermes messaging-channel routing is outside an editor
ACP server's scope.

### Project Context

The managed prompt detects the project root, manifests, package managers, git
branch/dirty state, and repository-defined verification commands. Facts refresh
after edits instead of relying on model guesses.

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, Go, Ruby, Java
- **Frameworks:** Next.js, React, Vue
- **Package managers:** uv, Poetry, npm, Yarn, pnpm
- **VCS:** git detection
- **Instructions:** `.hermes.md`, `HERMES.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GLM.md`, `.cursorrules`, and `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` are discovered from the project root toward accessed paths; newly applicable scoped rules are loaded before mutation
- **Memory:** approved reusable facts can be stored in `.glm-acp/memory.md`
- **Learned skills:** concise verified procedures are indexed from `.glm-acp/skills/*/SKILL.md` and loaded only when relevant
- **Relevance gates:** optional platform, project-environment, and required-tool metadata keeps unrelated skills out of context
- **Skill bundles:** related learned procedures can be progressively loaded as one bounded bundle
- **User profile:** explicitly approved preferences are stored privately in the user configuration directory and loaded across projects
- **Past work:** local FTS5 search recalls relevant user/assistant messages without indexing reasoning traces or credential-like values
- **Untrusted boundaries:** project context is scanned before prompt injection; tool, MCP, resource, and recalled text is explicitly delimited as data

### Coding Reliability

Every successful write is read back immediately. Python, JSON, and TOML receive
deterministic syntax checks; Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Rust also use
`pyright-langserver`, `typescript-language-server`, `gopls`, or `rust-analyzer`
when that executable is already on `PATH`. Missing or failed language servers do
not block the syntax fallback and are never installed automatically.

Verification evidence is project-scoped and persistent. Only commands matching
auto-detected canonical checks are ledgered; output text such as `echo pytest
passed`, non-executing flags, and status-masking pipelines, fallbacks, or command
sequences cannot satisfy the edit guard. Each later edit invalidates prior passing evidence,
and `/status` exposes the latest event plus whether a fresh pass exists.

Repeated unchanged file/search results are fingerprinted instead of re-injected.
The result-aware loop guard separately tracks identical failures, same-tool
failure streaks, and unchanged read-only outcomes, warning before a bounded stop.
Mixture of Agents is opt-in because it spends extra API tokens: reference reviews
run in parallel once per user turn, while the selected primary model remains the
only acting model and aggregates the private advice.

### Verified Learning

After a task changes files and passes a recognized test, build, lint, audit, or
verification command, the agent performs one learning review. It may propose a
concise reusable `SKILL.md` only when the task revealed a non-obvious procedure
or corrected pitfall likely to recur. Creating, refining, or removing a learned
skill uses the normal ACP permission dialog in Ask mode.

Learned skills are project-local under `.glm-acp/skills/`. Their metadata is
included in project context, while full instructions are loaded on demand to
avoid wasting tokens. Reading and refining skills records usage and revision
metadata. A deterministic curator marks unused skills stale after 30 days and
reversibly archives unpinned skills after 90 days; pinning is enforced in code.
Curation mutations use the normal permission dialog and never auto-delete.
Content hashes flag manually changed skills for review, and cheap description
overlap detection surfaces consolidation candidates without auto-merging them.

The model surveys existing skills before creating one and prefers refining a
skill used during the successful task. Credential-like content is rejected,
raw reasoning is never stored, and `forget_skill` can remove only agent-owned
learned skills—not user-authored `.agents` or `.codex` skills.

Skill refinement can also use an evaluator-gated candidate workflow. `evolve_skill`
can first create a non-promotable draft directly from bounded failed benchmark
traces. Promotion then requires compatible completed held-out reports, a higher
pass rate, no per-case regression, no worse median latency, and no increase in
input-plus-output token cost. Passing creates a separate integrity-checked
candidate file; promotion still uses the normal permission gate and is never
automatic. An auxiliary model may provide an advisory critique, but cannot
override the objective gates or replace the original rollback point.

Skill metadata may declare `environments: [python, git]`, `platforms: [linux]`,
`requires_tools: [run_command]`, or semantic `tasks: [security review]` tags.
Task-tagged skills enter the managed prompt only when the current request matches.
Irrelevant skills remain inspectable but are not loaded. Project-local bundles
group up to 12 relevant learned skills and an optional shared instruction without
duplicating their bodies.

Private cross-project facts are stored only after permission in the platform's
GLM ACP configuration directory as `user.md`. Project facts remain in
`.glm-acp/memory.md`. Both support exact, explicit forgetting.

### Search Quality

`search_files` and `grep` use ripgrep when available, respect `.gitignore`, bound
their output, and always skip
`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `dist`, `build`.

### Z.ai MCP

The agent includes stable tools for the official Coding Plan Web Search and Web
Reader remote MCP services. It also supports the local Z.ai Vision MCP server
and arbitrary user-configured Streamable HTTP or stdio MCP servers.

Vision MCP is optional and requires Node.js 22+ with `npx` on `PATH`; the first
call asks for permission before starting `@z_ai/mcp-server@latest`. Custom MCP
servers can be added to the user-only `mcp.json` beside `credentials.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "docs": {
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${DOCS_MCP_TOKEN}"}
    }
  }
}
```

Keep credentials in environment variables, not in this file. The built-in Z.ai
servers reuse the existing API key without printing or persisting it.

## Install

### One-command release install

Linux and macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/99percentgrip/Native-GLM-ACP/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
glm-acp --setup
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "install-glm-acp.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/99percentgrip/Native-GLM-ACP/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
& $installer
Remove-Item $installer
glm-acp --setup
```

The installers select the correct frozen binary, verify its published SHA-256
checksum, install without administrator privileges, and expose both `glm-acp`
and `native-glm-acp`. No Python or Node.js runtime is required. Open a new
terminal after installation if `glm-acp` is not immediately found.

To pin a release, set `GLM_ACP_VERSION=v2.0.5` before running the Unix
installer, or pass `-Version v2.0.5` to the downloaded PowerShell script.
The current release and manual-download fallback is
[v2.0.5](https://github.com/99percentgrip/Native-GLM-ACP/releases/tag/v2.0.5).

The setup prompts without echoing the API key and stores it in a user-only
configuration file. You can also keep using `ZAI_API_KEY` or `Z_AI_API_KEY`;
environment variables take precedence over stored credentials.

Default credential locations:

- Linux: `~/.config/glm-acp/credentials.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/glm-acp/credentials.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\glm-acp\credentials.json`

Set `GLM_ACP_CONFIG_DIR` to override the configuration directory. The key is
never printed or written to logs.

### One-command uninstall

For a public frozen-binary installation, run:

```bash
glm-acp --uninstall
```

This removes both installed command names, the installer-owned PATH entry, and
a matching custom `glm-acp` entry from Zed settings. Zed settings are backed up
before editing. Restart Zed afterward.

Credentials are preserved so reinstalling does not require entering the API key
again. To remove the stored credential too, use:

```bash
glm-acp --uninstall --purge
```

The command refuses to self-delete source installations and Registry-managed
copies. Remove Registry installations through Zed; remove development packages
with the package manager that installed them.

Configure the installed command as a custom Zed agent. ACP Registry publication
is tracked in
[agentclientprotocol/registry#439](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry/pull/439);
Registry installation becomes public after the Registry maintainers merge it.

### Development installation

The agent must be **installed into its virtualenv** so the `glm_acp`
Python module resolves regardless of which directory Zed launches the
subprocess from. A bare `git clone` is not enough — Zed sets the
subprocess `cwd` to whatever project you have open, and without an
install `python -m glm_acp` will fail with `ModuleNotFoundError` (exit
code 1) in any repo other than this one.

```bash
cd /path/to/glm-acp
uv pip install -e .
```

> ⚠️ If the agent crashes on startup in other repos with no visible
> error, re-run the install command above — the package is missing from
> the venv's `site-packages`.

## Standalone terminal agent

Zed is optional. On an interactive terminal, `chat` opens a full-screen TUI over the same
`GlmAcpAgent` object used by ACP clients—there is no reduced CLI-only agent loop.
Sessions, project instructions, every built-in tool, permissions, MCP/browser
integration, workflows, isolated workers, memory, slash commands, awareness,
metacognition, repository intelligence, checkpoints, and verification therefore
share one implementation and persistence format.

```bash
# Interactive session in the current project
glm-acp chat

# Work in another repository with explicit permissions and model settings
glm-acp chat --cwd /path/to/project --permission ask --model glm-5.2

# Resume the session ID printed when chat starts
glm-acp chat --cwd /path/to/project --resume SESSION_ID

# One-shot automation (Ask fails closed because no operator can approve)
glm-acp chat --cwd /path/to/project --permission read --prompt "Explain the test failure"
printf '%s\n' 'Review @diff' | glm-acp chat --cwd /path/to/project --stdin

# Explicitly authorized autonomous edit; use with care
glm-acp chat --cwd /path/to/project --permission bypass --prompt "Fix and verify the bug"

# Keep the original line-oriented interactive REPL
glm-acp chat --plain
```

The TUI uses a compact conversation-first layout; reasoning starts collapsed,
while activity, plan, context, and session state remain visible without taking
over the transcript. Type `/` to open the same live harness-command catalog
advertised to Zed. Use Up/Down to navigate, Tab to complete, Enter to run or
select, and Escape to close the menu.

A composer-adjacent status line gives immediate visual feedback for startup,
thinking, reasoning, tool work, approval, cancellation, completion, and
failures. Its animation pauses whenever the agent is idle, and streamed tool
titles are kept to one bounded line. Set `GLM_ACP_TUI_ANIMATION=0` before
launching `glm-acp chat` to keep the same status text with motion disabled.
Plain and JSON automation modes are unchanged.

Terminal-routed paste plus explicit Ctrl-V and Ctrl-Shift-V accept externally copied
multiline prompts, including clipboard text that begins with a blank line, and
present the retained content in the single-line composer. Ctrl-V uses the
platform clipboard command when available, under a short timeout and without
passing credentials to it. The composer remains fully separated from the Footer.

`/plan` directly switches among **Coding Plan**, **Standard API**, and
**BigModel (CN)**. `/thinking` selects **Off**, **Standard**, **Deep · High**, or
**Deep · Max** when supported by the active model. `/model`, `/permission`,
`/mode`, `/generation`, `/auxiliary`, and `/mixture` expose the remaining live
session controls through the same APIs as ACP editors. `/api-plan` and
`/endpoint` remain aliases for `/plan`; `/reasoning` remains an alias for
`/thinking`.

F1 displays `/help`, F2 toggles the live reasoning view, F3 opens all session
settings with models filtered by API plan and thinking levels filtered by model,
**F4 cycles a four-view working-tree panel** (session changes, git status, diff,
file browser) on the left side, and **F5 toggles push-to-talk** voice input.
Ctrl-C cancels the active turn, Ctrl-L clears only the visible transcript, and
Ctrl-X exits; F10 and `/exit` are equivalent. Ctrl-Q remains a hidden
compatibility binding because POSIX XON/XOFF terminals commonly swallow it.

The **composer stays enabled during active turns** — typing and pressing Enter
queues prompts that auto-drain FIFO when each turn completes, with a visible
queue-status line. Build the queue as long as needed; the agent processes each
queued prompt in order without losing input. Local and config commands
(`/plan`, `/thinking`, `/clear-view`, etc.) still work immediately during work.

**Push-to-talk (F5)** records from the microphone via `arecord` and transcribes
locally with `faster-whisper` (base model, 74 MB, cached after first use).
No API key, no internet, no per-request cost — voice stays on-device. The
transcribed text appends to the composer for review before sending. The frozen
binary bundles faster-whisper (156 MB on Linux); source installs use
`uv pip install -e ".[voice]"`.

**Notification sounds** (opt-in: `GLM_ACP_SOUND=1`) play a terminal bell on
turn completion or failure with a 5-second cooldown and are suppressed during
voice recording. **Smart desktop notifications** fire only for turns exceeding
10 seconds, are rate-limited to one per 30 seconds, and use `notify-send`
(Linux), `osascript` (macOS), or PowerShell (Windows). Disable with
`GLM_ACP_NOTIFY=0`.

**Codex-style right-click context menu** opens with **Ctrl+Right Click**
(or **Shift+Right Click** as a terminal-friendly fallback when the terminal
emulator intercepts Ctrl+Click, or **F6** as a pure-keyboard fallback) and
offers keyboard-navigable actions for the focused area:

| Area | Menu entries |
| --- | --- |
| Composer | Cut · Copy · Paste from clipboard · Select all · Copy last response · Copy all responses |
| Transcript | Copy selection · Select all output · Copy last response · Copy all responses · Paste to composer |

In addition, **Ctrl+Shift+C** copies the current Textual text selection and
**Ctrl+Y** copies the most recent agent response, both via credential-safe OS
clipboard helpers (`xclip`/`xsel`/`pbcopy`/`clip.exe`) with a
one-million-character bound.

Agent output is rendered as **structured Markdown** — headers, bullet points,
numbered lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and bold emphasis — with
a streaming-safe debounce that prevents re-parsing on every token.

Destructive Ask-mode actions use a bounded, credential-redacted
approval modal and deny by default. If a terminal reserves function keys,
`/reasoning-panel`, `/settings`, and `/clear-view` provide the same presentation
controls. Other slash commands—including `/status`, `/checkpoint`, and
`/awareness`—continue through the shared ACP agent runtime.

The session sidebar fetches authoritative Coding Plan quota telemetry once at
startup. Use `/usage` to refresh and display the provider-reported 5-hour model,
weekly model, and monthly MCP usage, remaining allowance, and reset time. The
query goes only to Z.ai's allowlisted HTTPS monitor endpoint and is never
estimated from local token counts; custom API hosts cannot receive the stored
credential.

Use `/image path/to/image.png` in an interactive chat to queue an image for the
next prompt, or repeat `--image PATH` for a one-shot vision prompt. `--json`
emits ACP session updates as JSON Lines for integrations, `--plain` selects the
line-oriented REPL, and `--no-thinking` hides live reasoning in plain mode.
`/exit` and `/quit` close either interactive frontend.
Bare `glm-acp` intentionally remains the stdio ACP server command used by Zed
and Registry installations.

## Configure Zed

Open Zed → Settings → Agent Settings → Add Agent → Add Custom Agent, then
add to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "glm-acp": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "glm-acp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Zed, open the Agent Panel, and select **Z.ai GLM** from the agent
dropdown. If Zed was already open during installation and does not inherit the
updated PATH, restart it or use the absolute installed command (`~/.local/bin/glm-acp`
on Linux and macOS).

If you use the development installation instead, keep the Python command,
`-m glm_acp` argument, working directory, and optional `ZAI_API_KEY` environment
entry from the earlier setup style.

## Models

| Model | Context | Plans | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| GLM-5.2 (Flagship) | 1M | All | Maximum reasoning, coding, agentic tasks (default) |
| GLM-5-Turbo | 200K | All | Flagship optimized for speed |
| GLM-4.7 | 200K | All | Balanced daily development |
| GLM-5V-Turbo | 200K | Standard, BigModel | Multimodal coding and agent workflows |
| GLM-4.5V (Vision) | 64K | Standard, BigModel | Screenshots, diagrams, charts |
| GLM-4.6V (Vision) | 128K | Standard, BigModel | Newer vision model with improved OCR |

## API Plans

| Plan | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Coding Plan (default) | `api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` | Subscription — text models only |
| Standard API | `api.z.ai/api/paas/v4` | Pay-as-you-go — text + vision models |
| BigModel (CN) | `open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` | Chinese mainland endpoint |

Direct vision model support requires Standard API or BigModel with sufficient
balance. Coding Plan users can use the separate official Vision MCP capability.

Z.ai's published supported-tool list does not currently name this Zed ACP
integration. Coding Plan availability is therefore subject to Z.ai's current
tool eligibility and usage policy; Standard API remains available independently.

```

### Context compaction

At 60%, 75%, and 85% usage the agent emits a single pressure diagnostic. When
usage exceeds **85%** of the context window:

1. System prompt preserved verbatim
2. 4 most recent messages kept (boundary adjusted to never split tool-call pairs)
3. Decisions, fixes, edited paths, command outcomes, unresolved work, plan state, and session lineage extracted deterministically
4. Older messages summarized via the selected auxiliary model, with optional `/compact <focus>` guidance
5. Verified decisions/fixes surfaced as permission-required memory proposals
6. Summary wrapped in `<conversation_summary>` tags with exact retained evidence
7. A persisted quality score is compared with prior compactions; declines trigger a warning and retained categories are reported

### Session persistence

- State saved to `~/.glm-acp/sessions/<session-id>.json` after every turn
- Session directories/files are created with user-only permissions on POSIX
- On restart, `load_session` / `resume_session` replays history + plan + config
- Sessions listed in Zed's history sidebar via `session/list`
- Fork support: duplicate a session to experiment while persisting parent and branch-root lineage
- `/lineage` identifies direct children and the parent session to resume for rollback
- Goals, subgoal acceptance criteria, judge budget, Mixture-of-Agents selection, and verification evidence persist with the session
- Closing an ACP session releases runtime resources without deleting searchable history
- A user-only SQLite FTS5 index enables recent-session browsing, keyword search, and contextual scrolling
- System prompts and `reasoning_content` are excluded from search; credential-like values are redacted before indexing

Set `GLM_ACP_SESSION_PERSISTENCE=0` to keep sessions process-local. Set
`GLM_ACP_PERSIST_REASONING=0` to persist messages without exact reasoning
traces; active Coding Plan turns still retain them in memory as required for
preserved-thinking requests.

After changing files, the agent requires a successful auto-detected canonical
build, test, lint, or other verification command before normal completion. A failed command or an
attempt to finish without verification triggers one focused recovery turn.
After successful verification of an edited task, one bounded learning review
decides whether a reusable skill is warranted; routine work stores nothing.

All file paths are validated against workspace roots. `update_plan` is
available in both Ask and Code modes.

Delegated workers cannot edit files, execute commands, call MCP, access
credentials, or delegate again, fixing delegation depth at one. Each worker is
limited to six read/search iterations and 180 seconds. One parent turn shares a
three-worker, 24-tool-call, 120K-input-token, and 16K-output-token budget across
all delegates. Their API usage is added to the parent session totals. Promptware
scanning is defense in depth: destructive operations still rely on ACP
permissions and workspace sandboxing.

### Local trajectory telemetry and lifecycle hooks

Metadata-only trajectory events are appended with user-only permissions to
`trajectory.jsonl` in the Native GLM ACP configuration directory. Set
`GLM_ACP_TELEMETRY=0` to disable them. Records include model/tool names,
durations, token counts, cache hits, changed-path counts, and verification state;
they exclude prompts, tool arguments and bodies, commands, reasoning, credentials,
and raw session IDs.

Lifecycle hooks are opt-in through user-only `hooks.json` (or
`GLM_ACP_HOOKS_CONFIG`). Each entry declares an event, an argv-form command, the
exact SHA-256 of its executable, an optional exact workspace scope, and a timeout
of at most 10 seconds. Supported events are `pre_tool_call`, `post_tool_call`,
`pre_verify`, and `post_llm_call`. Hash drift disables a hook, failures are
isolated, child environments are credential-scrubbed, and pre-verification
continuations are capped at three.

Playwright uses the optional `playwright` stdio MCP preset
(`npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest --headless --isolated`). Starting or calling it
is permission-gated, inherited credentials are removed, and the stable adapter
does not expose Playwright MCP's arbitrary JavaScript evaluation tools.

## Testing

```bash
cd /path/to/glm-acp
.venv/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Release verification also builds the wheel, source distribution, and frozen
PyInstaller executable. GitHub Actions runs the test suite and frozen-binary
smoke test on Linux x86-64/ARM64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon, and Windows x86-64.

Opt-in live quality evaluation uses isolated fixtures and objective test results:

```bash
# Safe preflight: validates the catalog and credential without an API request.
.venv/bin/python3 benchmarks/run_live.py --check

# Full handoff run: three attempts for each of the 11 cases.
.venv/bin/python3 benchmarks/run_live.py
```

The runner creates a timestamped folder under `quality/` containing
`native.json` and `report.md`. Send both files to the reviewer. The files never
contain the API key, reasoning traces, temporary workspaces, authentication
paths, or session IDs. Configure the credential with `glm-acp --setup` or in
`ZAI_API_KEY`; never put the key itself in the command line.

Only one live benchmark can run from a checkout at a time. Each attempt prints
its case, attempt number, outcome, and elapsed time. Both artifacts are updated
atomically after every completed attempt, so cancellation preserves usable
partial results and a stale lock is recovered automatically on the next run.

The catalog covers Python, TypeScript, Go, and Rust tasks including multi-file
changes, async cleanup, nested instructions, path security, and CLI behavior.
An external agent can run the same corpus with `--runner external
--external-command <command...>`. Generate a comparison table with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 benchmarks/report.py quality/native.json quality/competitor.json \
  --output quality/report.md
```

Reports contain outcome, end-to-end and first-delta latency, token totals,
candidate version/model, a system-prompt fingerprint, and non-identifying
runtime details. They exclude credentials, reasoning traces, authentication
paths, and session IDs. The manually triggered **Quality
benchmark** GitHub workflow provides an opt-in native run and job-summary
dashboard; it never runs live API usage on ordinary CI or pull requests.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent crashes on startup in other repos (exit 1, no error)

The most common cause: **the `glm_acp` package is not installed in the
virtualenv.** Python only finds it when run from this repo's directory
(the cwd is on `sys.path`), so opening any other project in Zed makes
`python -m glm_acp` exit with `ModuleNotFoundError`. Fix:

```bash
cd /path/to/glm-acp
uv pip install -e .
```

You can confirm it's installed by checking for the editable finder:

```bash
ls .venv/lib/*/site-packages/ | grep glm_acp
# expect: glm_acp-2.0.5.dist-info  (and editable-install metadata)
```

### Agent reports missing API credentials

Run `native-glm-acp --setup` (or `glm-acp --setup` for a Python install), or
set `ZAI_API_KEY` in the agent server's `env` block. Get a key at https://z.ai/.

### Vision models return content filter errors

The Coding Plan endpoint applies a strict content filter on image inputs.
Switch to **Standard API** in the API Plan dropdown and ensure you have
balance on your Z.ai account.

### Rate limit errors (429)

The agent automatically retries with provider-directed or jittered backoff (3 attempts). If
errors persist, the model will receive the error and can inform the user.
